    "bot_response": "I can't give you *perfect* notes on Artificial Intelligence (AI) because the field is vast and constantly evolving.  However, I can provide you with comprehensive notes covering key aspects. To make this manageable, we'll break it down into sections.  To give you the most relevant information, please tell me:\n\n1. **What is your current level of understanding of AI?** (Beginner, intermediate, advanced)  This will help me tailor the complexity of the notes.\n2. **What specific areas of AI are you most interested in?** (e.g., Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Robotics, Ethics of AI, specific applications like self-driving cars).  Focusing on specific areas will make the notes more focused and useful.\n3. **What is the intended purpose of these notes?** (e.g., general understanding, academic study, preparation for an exam, project research). This will influence the structure and depth of the notes.\n\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create a set of notes that are much more helpful and relevant to your needs.\n",
