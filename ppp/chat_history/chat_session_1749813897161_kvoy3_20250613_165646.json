Please provide the subject you want information about.  For example, you could ask:\n\n* \"Give me the concept of gravity; what is it and what about it?\"\n* \"Give me the concept of photosynthesis; what is it and what about it?\"\n\nOnce you specify \"it,\" I can explain the concept and relevant details.\n",
